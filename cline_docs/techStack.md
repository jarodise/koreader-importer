## Programming Languages

-   JavaScript: Primary language for Logseq plugin development.
-   HTML/CSS: For the plugin's user interface.

## Frameworks and Libraries

-   Logseq Plugin API: For interacting with Logseq and extending its functionality.
-   React (Potentially): If a complex UI is needed, React could be used for building interactive components.

## Build Tools

-   npm or yarn: For package management and dependency resolution.
-   Webpack or Parcel: For bundling the plugin code and assets.

## Architecture

-   Event-driven: The plugin will primarily respond to events triggered by user actions or Logseq's internal events.
-   Modular: The codebase will be organized into modules for better maintainability and scalability.

## Data Storage

-   Logseq's built-in data storage: The plugin will leverage Logseq's existing data storage mechanisms for storing imported annotations.

## External Dependencies

-   Potentially a parser library for handling Koreader's annotation file format, depending on its complexity.

## Project Goals

-   Develop a Logseq plugin to import Koreader annotations.
-   Enable users to seamlessly transfer their annotations from Koreader to Logseq.
-   Provide a user-friendly interface for the import process.

## Key Features

-   Automatically detect and parse Koreader annotation files.
-   Convert Koreader annotations into Logseq-compatible format.
-   Allow users to customize the import settings (e.g., choose destination page, format).
-   Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., invalid annotation file, network issues).

## Completion Criteria

-   The plugin can successfully import annotations from a valid Koreader annotation file.
-   Imported annotations are accurately represented in Logseq.
-   The plugin handles various edge cases and potential errors.
-   The plugin is thoroughly tested and documented.

## Progress Tracker

### Completed Tasks

-   [x] Create project directory and initialize documentation.

### Pending Tasks

-   [ ] Research Koreader annotation file format.
-   [ ] Design the plugin architecture and data flow.
-   [ ] Implement the annotation parsing logic.
-   [ ] Develop the Logseq integration.
-   [ ] Create the user interface for import settings.
-   [ ] Test the plugin with various scenarios.
-   [ ] Write comprehensive documentation.

## Scalability Considerations

-   Design the plugin to handle large annotation files efficiently.
-   Consider potential future integrations with other e-reader platforms.
-   Ensure the codebase is modular and maintainable for future updates.

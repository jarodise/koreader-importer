## Current Objectives

-   Research the Koreader annotation file format.
-   Design the plugin architecture and data flow.

## Context

-   The user wants to build a Logseq plugin that can import Koreader annotations.
-   The project directory is located at `/Users/jarodise/Documents/GitHub/logseq-koreader-importer`.
-   We have created the `cline_docs` folder and the following documentation files: `projectRoadmap.md`, `techStack.md`, and `codebaseSummary.md`.

## Next Steps

-   Research Koreader annotation file format (referencing the "Research Koreader annotation file format" task in `projectRoadmap.md`). This involves finding documentation or examples of the file format used by Koreader to store annotations.
-   Design the plugin architecture and data flow (referencing the "Design the plugin architecture and data flow" task in `projectRoadmap.md`). This involves determining how the plugin will parse the annotation file, convert it to a Logseq-compatible format, and interact with the Logseq API.
-   Create a basic Logseq plugin structure with necessary files (e.g., `package.json`, `index.html`, `index.js`).

## Key Components and Their Interactions

-   **Annotation Parser**: Responsible for reading and parsing Koreader annotation files. It interacts with the **Data Converter** to transform the parsed data.
-   **Data Converter**: Transforms the parsed annotation data into a Logseq-compatible format. It interacts with the **Logseq Interface**.
-   **Logseq Interface**: Handles the communication with the Logseq API, sending the converted data to Logseq for import.
-   **User Interface**: Provides a user-friendly way to configure import settings and interact with the plugin. It interacts with the **Annotation Parser** and **Logseq Interface**.

## Data Flow

1. The user selects a Koreader annotation file through the plugin's UI.
2. The **Annotation Parser** reads and parses the file.
3. The parsed data is passed to the **Data Converter**.
4. The **Data Converter** transforms the data into a Logseq-compatible format.
5. The **Logseq Interface** sends the formatted data to Logseq via the Logseq API.
6. Logseq imports the data, creating new blocks or updating existing ones.

## External Dependencies

-   Logseq Plugin API: Used for interacting with Logseq.
-   Potential parser library for handling the Koreader annotation file format (to be determined after researching the format).
-   `projectRoadmap.md`: Contains the high-level project goals and roadmap.
-   `currentTask.md`: Outlines the current objectives and next steps.
-   `techStack.md`: Details the chosen technologies and architecture.

## Recent Significant Changes

-   Created the `cline_docs` directory and initial documentation files (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`).

## User Feedback Integration and Its Impact on Development

-   Currently, no user feedback has been integrated.
-   Future user feedback will be used to improve the plugin's functionality, usability, and performance.
